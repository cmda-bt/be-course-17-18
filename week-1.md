#### <a name="week-1-run-a"></a> Step A

If you haven’t already, [sign up for GitHub and install a text

Create a directory on your computer, `run`.  In it, create a file `tutorial.sh`
and copy-paste the complete following document into it.

<details>
<summary><code>tutorial.sh</code> (click the arrow to expand)</summary>

```sh
#!/bin/bash

</details>

#### <a name="week-1-run-d"></a> Step D

In your terminal, go to the `run` directory and enter it (**hint**: use the
`cd` command to “change directories”).

If you now run `ls` (to print out files) in the directory, you should see the
tutorial:

```sh
$ ls
# tutorial.sh
```

Now, run the tutorial with `sh tutorial.sh`:

```sh
$ sh tutorial.sh
# Hi! 👋
# Follow this tutorial by running `sh tutorial.sh`.  Stuck?  Use `man` (such
# as `man ls`) in another tab for help!
#
# Results (0/14)
# …
```

This tutorial is interactive.  Answer any questions it asks you, until it sends
you back here.
